# ReaWwise

ReaWwise is a REAPER extension that sound designers can use to transfer audio files from REAPER into Wwise projects. The transfer process creates Wwise objects in manually defined hierarchies, so that Wwise users can start working with the imported sounds immediately. ReaWwise supports all REAPER wildcards and is available through the ReaPack package manager and the [releases page](https://github.com/audiokinetic/ReaWwise/releases) of this repository.

## Building from Source

### Requirements
- Git
- CMake (minimum version 3.22.0)
- Platform-specific build tools (Visual Studio or XCode)
- Wwise with SDK (minimum version 2021.1.1)
- WWISESDK environment variable set to the path of the installed Wwise SDK

### Building
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/audiokinetic/ReaWwise.git
cd ReaWwise
git submodule update --init
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target ReaWwise --config Release
```
